People are sharing screenshots in word documents.
Therefore I share pictures as excel shit.

# History

I was complaining on IRC about someone sending me a screenshot as a word file. 
Then my friend **Aaron Lav** had a comment that I turned into that project:

<asl2> much rarer to encode screenshots in excel with a cell per pixel


# Usage

It probably works with any python. You need the packages *imageio* and *xlsxwriter*.

```
python conv.py picture.jpg picture.xlsx
```

Careful, the output files look small, but they may take a while to open.
